# NYT-Trending

Android app developed in parallel with a web internal tool to visualize what articles are trending and where in the world. 

The entire project was built with a team of 7 interns that owned the entire development process 
from data retrieval in The New York Times' database and backend development to the development of the web interface and this 
Android application. 

I individually built this application in conjunction with the other team members working on the different parts of the project.
